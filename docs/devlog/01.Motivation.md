# TAZB Dev Log

## 1. Motivation

##### What is TAZB?
Totally Awesome Zero-Based Budget (TAZB) is a monthly budgeting app.  At the start of the month, a user can create
budget categories and assign dollar values to them.  As the month goes on, the user enters their expenses and assigns
them to a category.  Throughout the month, the user is able to see how closely their expected values compare to what was
actually spent in each category.

##### Why create TAZB?
I am creating TAZB because I want to track my personal finances, but I do not want to give all my financial data to a
corporation. Also, I want to build an app from the ground up. Then, I want to change it.

In software development, a great deal of effort is put into making things easy to change, so I want to create a
minimum-viable-product (MVP), then change it into a feature-rich application. Along the way, I will observe what is hard
to change, and what isn't.
like. 

##### What will the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) look like?
First, I will create the most basic application that will fill the need. In this case, the need is me (a single user)
tracking his personal finances on a monthly basis.

###### Application Framework
One of my goals with this project is to learn how to make applications that are easy to change. Creating a monolithic
application will allow rapid initial development and maximum potential for change. Later in the project's
life-cycle, I may want to support more than one user, or switch front-end technologies, or change the back-end to a
microservices architecture.

I know a bit about Spring Boot, but I want to learn it better, so MVP will be a monolithic Spring Boot application.

- Thymeleaf - Template Engine to structure and display data
- Bootstrap 5 - Reactive CSS Framework to style the display
- Spring Security - Username and Password Authentication
- Spring MVC - Model View Controller Framework
- Spring Data JPA - Database Access (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

###### Database
To further my goal of learning how to make applications that are easy to change, I will control the database design
rather than letting Spring Data JPA / Hibernate generate it. I will write SQL scripts to create PostgreSQL schemas, 
tables, and constraints; then use Flyway to apply the migrations. I have a feeling that a poorly designed database 
will make an  application nearly impossible to change; hopefully my initial design is at least somewhat poor, so I 
can feel the pain and learn some lessons about making database designs that are easy to change.

###### Operating System and Hardware and Deployment
I have a few Raspberry Pi 3B+ laying around. I will install Ubuntu on one and manually deploy the application to it.
Once again starting with the minimum viable with an emphasis on change. The MVP will only be accessible from within my
LAN.
